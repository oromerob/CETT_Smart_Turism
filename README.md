## ABSTRACT
Urban tourist destinations’ increasing popularity has been a catalyst for discussion about the tourist activity
geographical circumscription. In this context, Big Data and more specifically location-based social networks
(LBSN), appear as a valuable source of information to approach tourist and residents spatial interactions from
a renewed perspective. This paper focuses on approaching similarities and differences of tourists and
residents’ geographical and functional use of urban economic units. A user classificatory algorithm has been
developed and applied on YELP’s Dataset for that purpose. A residents and tourists integration ratio has then
been calculated and applied by types of businesses categories and their associated spatial distribution of the
of 11 metropolitan areas provided in the sample: Champaign (Illinois, US), Charlotte (North Carolina, US),
Cleveland (Ohio, US), Edinburgh (Scotland, UK), Las Vegas (Nevada, US), Madison (Wisconsin, US),
Montreal (Quebec, CA), Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania, US), Phoenix (Arizona, US), Stuttgart (DE) and Toronto
(Ontario, CA). Business category results show strong similarities in tourists and residents functional
coincidence in the use of urban spaces and leisure offer, while there is a clear geographical concentration of
activity for both user types in all analysed case studies.
